      <h3>Hello I am Nerios,<br />Front End Engineer currently working and living in London.</h3>
      <p>Ever Since I became fascinated with the power of technology, I’ve devoted my time to intertwining man and machine through interactive interfaces, design and new technologies of the web. I foster productivity in a collaborative environment that meets the requirements of engineers and creatives at the same time. I can work on anything related to web apps, but if I had to choose I’d rather focus on frontend technologies.</p>
